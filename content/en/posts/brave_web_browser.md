How can we get a mostly ad-free web browsing experience that is easy to setup, doesn't break too much websites and somewhat protects our privacy?

Brave browser is a controversial open source browser by JavaScript creator Brendan Eich.

It features an advanced fingerprinting protection. This is needed because modern fingerprinting techniques work by tracking things like your device battery level or how you hold your device.
In recent comparisons with the other popular browsers Brave was the only one that passed this test. 

Another highlight is the integrated tor browser (only on desktop).
This is very handy to check if a website is down for everyone or just for me. Also to see if IP locks are in place.

The team behind it also tries to create a new search engine. Which is good, because there are not many good privacy focused search engines.

The most controversial thing is its reward program.
You earn Brave's crypto currency called BAT by opting into ads. Then you can tip content creators with your BATs.
This reminds many about what other ad-blocker did in the past. Block the website owner's ads and show theirs instead.

Brave is availabe for many platforms. Check the official website.
