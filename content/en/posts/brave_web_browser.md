How can we get a mostly **ad-free** web browsing experience that is **easy to setup**, doesn't break too much websites and somewhat **protects our privacy**?

Brave browser is a controversial **open source** browser by JavaScript creator **Brendan Eich**.

## Privacy

It features an **advanced fingerprinting protection**. This is needed because modern fingerprinting techniques work by tracking things like your device battery level or how you hold your device.
Brave tends to archive very good results on fingerprinting tests like [Cover Your Tracks from the EFF](https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/).

Another highlight is the integrated tor browser (only on desktop).
This is very handy to check if a website is down for everyone or just for me. Also to see if IP locks are in place.

Furthermore the team behind it tries to create a new search engine. Which is good, because there are not many good privacy focused search engines.

## Rewards

The most controversial thing is its reward program.

You earn Brave's <b>crypto currency</b> called BAT by opting into ads. Then you can tip content creators with your BATs.
This reminds many about what other ad-blocker did in the past. Block the website owner's ads and show theirs instead.
You can also payout your BATs to earn some money (<10 $) every month.

## Get Brave
